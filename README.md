# Composing Gatsby Themes

## An advanced workshop

ðŸ¦‹ hi there! My name is [Chris Biscardi](https://christopherbiscardi.com) and this is the
source material for [Composable Gatsby Themes](https://ti.to/egghead-live-online-events/composing-gatsby-themes-with-chris-biscardi-2019-10-23/discount/egh-early)!

following:

      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Watch [Gatsby Theme Authoring](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring)
      by Jason Lengstorf, or have the equivalent experience (58 minutes)
- [ ] Optionally, read up on themes development [on my blog](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/tags/gatsby-themes)

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## System Requirements
