# Composing Gatsby Themes

## An advanced workshop

ðŸ¦‹ hi there! My name is [Chris Biscardi](https://christopherbiscardi.com) and this is the
source material for [Learn React Hooks](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/hooks)!

## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

In order for us to maximize our efforts during the workshop, please do the
following:

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below) (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Watch [Gatsby Theme Authoring](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring)
      by Jason Lengstorf, or have the equivalent experience (58 minutes)
- [ ] Optionally, read up on themes development [on my blog](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/tags/gatsby-themes)

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.20.1 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v11.15.0 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v1.19.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

If you'd rather be able to work through the workshop on your own computer, then
follow the following instructions.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advanced-gatsby-themes-workshop-code.git
cd advanced-gatsby-themes-workshop-code
```

If you can't work it out on your own
then please [file an issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the
commands you ran (even if it's a lot).
